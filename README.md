## Traffic Accident Analysis – Key Findings
Intersections are high-risk zones
A large portion of crashes occurred at or near intersections, indicating conflict points between vehicles.

Rear-end collisions are the most common crash type
This suggests issues like tailgating, sudden braking, or distracted driving.

Peak accident times occur during rush hours
Morning and evening traffic congestion increases crash probability.

Urban areas show higher crash density
Due to higher traffic volume and complex road layouts.

Human factors dominate crash causes
Speeding, distraction, and rule violations are more common causes than vehicle failure.

Certain days show higher accident rates
Weekends or Fridays often have increased crashes due to travel and social activities
